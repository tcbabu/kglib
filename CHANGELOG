Ver 1.3.4
Many fixes and an inclusion of Gph file creation using kgInitGph.
This useful for creating gphfile and for postscript hardcopy without
opening a X Display, so background execution is possible. Also
'hlih.c' is added and a pscript call is added to create postscript hardcopy
in A4 portait or landscape.

Ver 1.3

Main change is support for copy/paste, ie support for
Primary and Clipboard from X. It is a classic example of how
a fairly simple concept can be made very complex. These
is a typical example when one curses the decision to develop
on Xlib. Following routines are added (all are not related
to copy/paste).

unsigned char *kgGetPrimary(void * Tmp);
unsigned char *kgGetClipBoard(void * Tmp);
int kgSetPrimary(void * Tmp,unsigned char *data);
int kgSetClipBoard(void * Tmp,unsigned char *data);
void * kgProcessClips(void *Tmp,void *kbtmp);
int kgEnableSelection(void *Tmp);
int kgDisableSelection(void *Tmp);
int kgClearHighlight(void *Tmp);
int kgCheckSelection(void *Tmp);
int kgSetClipbordCallback(void *Tmp,int *(cpCallback)(int,void *));
int kgSetClipMenu(void *Tmp,char **menu);

void *kgGetProcessedImage(void *timg,int Bsize,float rfac,
                         int Btred,int Btgreen,int Btblue);
int kgSearchString(char *s1,char *s2);
char *kgGetIcon(char *pgr,char *theme);
void *kgSearchIcon(char *IconName);
int kgImageCopy(void *Tmp,char *imgname);

There is also an update on 'kgReview()'

Also there is some modifications in 'kgdevelop'.
